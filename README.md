INSIGHTS:
Firstly this project taught me new concepts as the data was too big and it caused a lot of problem while importing and due to that reasons I shifted to jupyter Notebook and Tableau and hence got to learn about few different libraries though I felt completing it in the MySQL Workbench and hence I had to flush privileges in the MySQL Command Line as it was causing few errors so basically troubleshooting.
